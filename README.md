# Tlyx's CTF Write-ups

Hi there! I'm Tlyx, a cybersecurity student and CTF enthusiast. I created this repository to share the fun challenges that I've solved in CTF.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, you'll find a folder for each CTF I've participated in. Within each folder, you'll find at least a write-up of a challenges I solved. I hope that my write-ups will be useful to others who are interested in CTFs and looking to improve their skills. I'm still a beginner but I'm trying to get better !
